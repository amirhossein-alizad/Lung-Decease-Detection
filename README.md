# neural-network-phase2
an AI course project in University of Tehran, training and testing a neural network using Keras library.<br>
you will need to install keras library.<br>
because the dataset is too large you will have to use google colab in order to run and test the code, and also you will have to add the dataset to your google drive from this link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WZTP-S-_8YVu5XFJ1cXCCQ65jNQGx32o/view .<br>
you will have to use google colab GPU to run this project.<br>
we used keras library to implement a neural network with different optimizers, loss functions, regularizers, momentum, etc.<br>
